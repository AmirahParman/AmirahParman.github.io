# My Online Resume
This is my personal online resume built with Angular. It is still a work in progress.

I am working by stages to include mutiple tabs into this resume to showcase other information and descriptions.

## How it is created
I started with dividing the website into reusable components - Header, content and navigation layout after which I used HTML, TypeScript and SCSS classes. Classes are created for every component, exported and datas are hardcoded into the TypeScript file.
